Hello, and welcome to the Preoccupied Podcast, a show where we examine people's stories, thoughts, and concerns - in short, what they're preoccupied with. The show will feature interviews with people from various professions and backgrounds to encompass a wide breadth of perspectives. 

The intention is to examine the thoughts that we just can't seem to shake, in an effort to find people's various passions and ambitions.
